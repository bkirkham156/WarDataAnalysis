# 🪖 War Data Analysis

**A data-driven exploration of global conflicts, casualties, and long-term trends**

This project analyzes a historical dataset of wars and conflicts, focusing on patterns in duration, casualties, geographic distribution, and type of warfare. Using Python-based data analysis and visualization, the notebook uncovers how conflicts have evolved over time and what factors influence their severity.

## 📁 Project Overview

The notebook (`Project1Data.ipynb`) performs an end-to-end analysis of a war dataset that includes:

* Conflict names
* Countries/regions involved
* Start and end years
* Duration
* Casualty estimates
* War type (civil war, interstate conflict, etc.)

The project’s goals include:

* Understanding long-term trends in conflict frequency
* Comparing casualty distributions
* Examining relationships between war type and severity
* Visualizing notable spikes in global conflict
* Identifying patterns across centuries

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Handling missing values
* Standardizing year ranges
* Fixing date inconsistencies
* Converting quantitative fields for analysis

### **2. Exploratory Analysis**

* Number of conflicts over time
* Distribution of war durations
* Top deadliest wars
* Casualty trends by region
* Average casualties by war type

### **3. Visualizations Include**

* Line charts of war frequency
* Bar charts of largest conflicts
* Histograms of duration and casualties
* Scatterplots to detect relationships between variables
* Grouped comparisons between war types

---

## 🔍 Insights & Findings (Summary)

* Conflicts increase noticeably in the 19th–20th centuries
* Casualty distributions are heavily right-skewed
* Civil wars often last longer but have lower average casualties
* Industrial-era wars show dramatic increases in lethality
* A small number of world conflicts account for a majority of total casualties
